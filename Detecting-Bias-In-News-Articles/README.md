# Detecting-Bias-In-News-Articles

In light of the number of news articles available with varying quality and political
polarization, it can be difficult for an average reader to always recognize the inherent
bias in the news article. In this project, as we retrieve news articles based on
keywords and a series of user preferences such as publications and timeframe, we
want to draw attention to the potential influence news articles can have on the
readers as seen in the word choices. To this purpose, we built an information
organization and retrieval system that organizes news articles based on where they
fall on the political spectrum as well as how “biased” the articles are in their word
choices. This capability will hopefully help our users choose a balanced and
high-quality set of news articles to read
